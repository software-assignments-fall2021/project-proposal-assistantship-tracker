# Student Assistantship Time Tracker
Proposal by Desmond Ofori Atta and Prince Ampofo Larbi

## What?
Student Assistantship Time Tracker is a mobile application that allows users to track the time they have worked across all their jobs.

## Why?
In NYUAD , in order for students to input the number of hours they have worked per day, they need to log into their student assistantship portal on the student portal. Since logging in on mobile phones aren't that feasible, users wait to get back to their laptops before doing this. In most cases, students might forget and would not be able to track theirs hours accurately.Therefore, this mobile app would help them to key in the time they have worked and then key in everything into the portal at the end of the month.

## Target Audience
NYUAD students who are employed in on campus jobs. But can be used by anyone who wants to track their work hours and how much they are expected to earn.

## How?
The how is simple:

- Sign Up / Log in
- Add a job if none exist (You can add as many as you want)
- For a particular job you just completed, choose the start and end time and how much it pays per hour. 
- Update a particular entry if you made a mistake.
- Delete jobs you are no longer working on/in.
- Access features such as total pay for the month, week, and year or equivalent for each job.

## Scope
These will be implemented:

- Sign up and sign in authorisation. We will use google, facebook and email sign up/sign in. 
- Home page that shows analytics such as total salary earned for the month and year. Also a navigation bar to jobs and user profile.
- Jobs page that shows all the current jobs and hours. Each job in turning opening a page where you can update the details or delete it.
- Data management operations will be done using Google firebase/firestore.
- Business logic files for calculations and analysis.
